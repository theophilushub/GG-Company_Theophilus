Observation and Recommendation
December is the best performing month of the year followed by June and from January till December the sales flow seems not to be consistent and good enough, also the best performing state is Newyork.
further more the best selling product of the year is coffee followed by curry sauce.
Also the affordable products seems to have more market than the more expensive, the north region that has the best sales, bought more of the more affordable products than the expensive once, and their patronage drop from buying goods within the range of 0 - $1000 (67) down to just 2 due to the high range of price $4000 - $5000, and they have no sales record from $6000.
Also Nancy Freehafer is the best performing sales rep of the year.
if there was any form of advertisement or bonuses that took place in December it will be better that such is repeated for other months to have a consistent flow of good sales
since affordable products sells more than the more expensive once, i will recommend that the company produce more of affordable product.
Since Nancy stands out as the best sales rep with performance, it will be best if Nancy ideas and influence could be share to other region. the likes of the easy region could have Nancy around, posted there for  a minimum of three months
